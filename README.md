# Exploratory Data Analysis of Medicare data 


+ **Project summary**: In this report, we present our exploratory data analysis, interactive plots, animations and many other interesting insights into the Medicare data. We focus on analyzing the Medicare data of different states in U.S., for the reason that we wish to explore the factors that influence the hospital rating and display the medical imbalance in different states.


+ **Dataset**: The data we use is sourced from the [Medicare.gov](https://data.medicare.gov/), which is the official website for the U.S. governmentâ€™s Medicare program and is managed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency that administers the Medicare program.
